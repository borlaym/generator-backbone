# Yeoman SubGenerators for the Kriek Template

Maintainer: [MÃ¡rton Borlay](https://github.com/borlaym)

Forked from the Backbone Generator.
Right now only the subgenerators work for this template : https://github.com/borlaym/kriek_template
TODO: full project generator.

## Installation

1. Clone the kriek_template repository
`$ git clone https://github.com/borlaym/kriek_template.git`

Make a new directory and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo backbone`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo backbone [app-name]
```

## Generators

Available generators:

- backbone:model
- backbone:view
- backbone:collection
- backbone:router
- backbone:all

## Typical workflow

```
yo backbone # generates your application base and build workflow
yo backbone:model blog
yo backbone:collection blog
yo backbone:router blog
yo backbone:view blog
grunt server
```
